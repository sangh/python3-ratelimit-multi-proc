        """Run `query_fn(conn, ret_lst, *args, **kwargrs)` within an exclusive
        lock on the connected Sqlite DB (accessed via `conn`).

        See the `README.md` file for some usage examples.

        Ridiculously the sqlite module doesn't do locking by default even
        though the docs kinda imply that `with conn...` is enough to do so.
        Instead you have to say the magic words AND you have to make sure you
        actually call commit or rollback to release the exclusive lock.
        
        So this function takes a function that takes the connection where
        whatever happens in the function is isolated.

        The query_fn *should not* call commit, callback, or close.  If the
        query_fn returns cleanly then `commit()` is called, if it raises an
        exception then `rollback()` is called and the same exception is
        re-raised from this function.  In every case the connection is closed
        before returning (via the finally clause).

        The query_fn should also not return anything (anything returned will
        be ignored), instead, if it wants it can appended one value to ret_lst.
        We do this b/c the function or the sqlite statements could throw and
        if sqlite throws after the function is called we do not want to call
        the function again.  This allows query_fn to have sqlite calls both
        before and after anything else it wants to do.

        That means that query_fn should _check_ if there are any values in
        ret_lst and not do the non-DB stuff if so.
